# Solution

In order to solve the problem, we first add up the total sum of the range from 0 to N and then we subject every value in nums from the total sums, allowing us to get the missing number
Complexity:
- Splace Complexity: O(1) -> Did not create any additional space
- Time Complexity: O(N) -> Iterating throug the whole lists means that we require O(N) time
